# Scoutstrap
A simple fork of Bootstrap to provide (UK) Scout style themeing to all your projects!

## Documentation
We've also forked the Bootstrap documentation to provide some reading material. (Hosted on GitHub pages)

Docs: https://scoutstrap.github.io

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are very welcome, open a pull request and we'll look to get it merged in. 


## ToDo
Features and things we want to do:
- Add in multiple variations of colours (i.e. different primaries)
- Further styles and options of Navbars

Open an issue if you have any other requests!
